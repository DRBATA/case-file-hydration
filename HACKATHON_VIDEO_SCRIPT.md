### **Chunk 1 (0:00 - 0:15) - INTRO**
```
Another late night in the data district.
A booking came in ‚Äî ice bath, sauna, a ginger shot on the side.
But I'd seen this story before.
Fatigue. Headaches. Hydration gone missing.
```

### **Chunk 2 (0:15 - 0:30) - THE INVESTIGATION**
```
The case wasn't just booking itself.
It was the trail of data left behind.
Supabase held the records.
Stripe guarded the payments.
And Resend? Well, Resend had to deliver the message...
or the kid was outta luck.
```

```
See, this wasn't just about hydration.
It was about orchestration.
Three MCP servers working together ‚Äî
Supabase, Stripe, Resend ‚Äî
all laid up in a bow.
An autonomous agent for wellness.
```

The cure arrived.

Fork it. Clone it. Crack your own case.
The repo's yours now, detective.
