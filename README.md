# Water Bar Email#  Case File: Hydration

*Another late night in the data district.*

**Supabase** had the records.  
**React** wrote the story.  
**Resend** delivered the goods.

This isn't just another email server â€” it's an **MCP crew** working together to solve the hydration case.

## ?? Planned Future Flows (Beyond Hackathon Demo)

This repo currently showcases **Flow 1: AOI Booking Confirmation**.  
We’ve also designed (not demoed here) additional flows:
- ?? Hydration plan generation (Supabase ? Resend)
- ?? On-venue orchestration (timeline + paired drinks)
- ?? Combined experience recap (Stripe ? Resend ? Supabase)

These are detailed in **docs/Confidential/APPENDIX_CASE_NOTES.md**,  
but only Flow 1 is guaranteed to work out-of-the-box for hackathon judges.
