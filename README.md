# Water Bar Email#  Case File: Hydration

*Another late night in the data district.*

**Supabase** had the records.  
**React** wrote the story.  
**Resend** delivered the goods.

This isn't just another email server — it's an **MCP crew** working together to solve the hydration case.

##  The Demo

[Watch the case unfold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) *(add your video link)*

---

##  The Evidence

- **Supabase MCP** → Pulls the booking (neat, precise)
- **React Email** → Dresses it up sharp (timeline, purple gradient, paired drinks)
- **Resend MCP** → Slips it into the inbox (no middlemen)
- **Supabase logs** → Keeps the receipts (sent, delivered, timestamped)

**Case closed.**

## ?? Planned Future Flows (Beyond Hackathon Demo)

This repo currently showcases **Flow 1: AOI Booking Confirmation**.  
We�ve also designed (not demoed here) additional flows:
- ?? Hydration plan generation (Supabase ? Resend)
- ?? On-venue orchestration (timeline + paired drinks)
- ?? Combined experience recap (Stripe ? Resend ? Supabase)

These are detailed in **docs/Confidential/APPENDIX_CASE_NOTES.md**,  
but only Flow 1 is guaranteed to work out-of-the-box for hackathon judges.
