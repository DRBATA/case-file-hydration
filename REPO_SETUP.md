# 📦 GitHub Repo Setup Instructions

## ✅ **YOU'RE READY! Here's What to Do:**

---

## 🎯 **STEP 1: Create GitHub Repo**

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `case-file-hydration` (or whatever you prefer)
3. **Description:** "🕵️ MCP-powered email orchestration for wellness bookings | Windsurf Hackathon 2025"
4. **Visibility:** Public
5. **DON'T** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## 🎯 **STEP 2: Push Your Code**

```powershell
# Navigate to your MCP server folder
cd ./your-project\mcp-waterbar-emails

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "🕵️ Initial commit: Case File Hydration MCP Server"

# Add remote (REPLACE WITH YOUR GITHUB USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/case-file-hydration.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## ✅ **WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE REPO:**

```
case-file-hydration/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts              # Main MCP server
│   └── emails/               # React Email templates
│       ├── aoi-booking-confirmation.tsx
│       ├── water-bar-order-confirmation.tsx
│       ├── water-bar-followup.tsx
│       └── water-bar-missed-you.tsx
├── build/                    # Compiled JavaScript (gitignored)
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── README.md                 # Noir-themed README
├── HACKATHON_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md
├── AUTONOMOUS_EMAIL_SYSTEM.md # Full architecture (optional)
└── .gitignore
```

---

## ❌ **WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED (Secret Sauce):**

- ❌ `.env` files
- ❌ `node_modules/`
- ❌ Webhook endpoints (`/api/webhooks/*`)
- ❌ Dexie update logic
- ❌ `/log-consumption` page
- ❌ Full autonomous loop details

**Why?** These are your competitive advantages. The repo shows the MCP orchestration, but keeps the full system architecture private.

## 🎥 **STEP 3: Add Video to README**

After recording your video:

1. Upload to YouTube
2. Copy the video ID (e.g., `dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
3. Update README.md line 15:

```markdown
## 🎬 The Demo

[▶️ Watch the case unfold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID)
```

4. Commit and push:
```powershell
git add README.md
git commit -m "📹 Add demo video link"
git push
```

```
